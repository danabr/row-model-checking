%% This projects implements a model of working with a read-your-own write
%% key/value store, exploring how to deal with potential race conditions.
%% The idea is to generate all possible orderings of two operation flows,
%% and see if we can get a race condition or an inconsistent state.
%% Below follows a list of operations and their semantics:
%% get - Read object from the db. Stop flow on no object or siblings.
%% get_check - Read object from the db. Stop on vclock mismatch or siblings.
%% check - Check a precondition for continuing the flow.
%% write - Write object to db. Crash on siblings.
%% txn - Register side effect
%% Investigate: Net splits
%% Investigate: Report siblings
%% Investigate: Update VClock on delete?
